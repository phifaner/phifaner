The pervasiveness of location-aware devices has spawned extensive research in trajectory data mining. Yet, leaking individual sensitive information incurs the privacy concern and create obstacles for data holders to release trajectory data. $k$-anonymity and differential privacy are the most popular solutions that provide data privacy in different angles, i.e., $k$-anonymity aims to defending the linkage attack, while differential privacy limits the knowledge gain from query responses. Moreover, trajectories data is quite skewed over time and space. How to choose an appropriate policy to protect trajectory data is a big challenge. In this project, an interactive tool is designed to allow users to apply a privacy policy with an optimal parameter on trajectories in a tempo-spatial subspace. Particularly, a hierarchical index is proposed to compute frequent items of L-sequence trajectories efficiently. In addition, concerning publishing trajectories in a large number of subspace, a propagated algorithm is proposed to achieve a maximum score in both privacy and utility.
