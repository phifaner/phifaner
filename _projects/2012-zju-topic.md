Based on collecting consumption records of ten thousands customers, we developed an application to recommend appropriate hairstyles and cosmetics to customers of their intrest. We leveraged multiple user-based collaborative filtering algorithms for recommending w.r.t 30+ dimensions. And the overall performance was up to 86\%. Additionally, an ETL tool and data managment system were developed based on MonetDB. After running for 19 months, the startup company was bought by an inverstor.
