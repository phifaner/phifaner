To boost the scalability of the financial system for Hunan government, we designed and developed a B/S platform using J2EE frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, JSTL, etc). The B/S platform was designed in collaboration with financial officers based on a prior system developed in PowerBuilder. In this platform, we employed a master-slave distributed database system to manage transactions, and utilized Spring as the backbone to construct the platform. Because J2EE was quite a new technology for the company, training and debugging were exerted along with the system development. The team members increased from 5 to 20 as the project stepped forward.
